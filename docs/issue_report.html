            Since we use private keys and identifiers when working with AdSDK, we accept private issue reports by email.

                    Please note that you don't have debug symbols if you use Swift Package Manager to integrate
                    SDK.<br />
                    If you need debug symbols to better understand the issue, you can request an SDK with them from us.
